# ehcache-rest-server

An implementation that makes Ehcache Operations accessible via REST/JSON
Note: Currently adapted/modernized from former ehcache-server version -- http://www.ehcache.org/documentation/2.7/modules/cache-server.html.

Leverages Spring-Boot, JAX-RS (Jersey2), SwaggerUI and provides Docker capability for ease of testing.

(work in progress still...)
